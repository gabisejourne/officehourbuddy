 Being such a large website, we felt it would be practical to take you through the design of Office Hour Buddy page by page
    in order to give you a view "under the hood."
    
    After visting http://officehourbuddy/ you'll encounter a page with a log in button. After clicking on the button,
    the website will call upon cs50 id (given by cs50 staff) and take you to a standard harvard login page.
    Once there, we chose to allow the user to login using either their:
 
    1) student id number and password,
    2) @college email address and password
    3) @fas email address and password.
    
    *NOTE* If you choose to login with an email address, the website will redirect you to a page where you will input your first and last
    name so it can be added to the database. (This may or may not work, but we requested cs50 to allow us to login by email, but we're not
    sure if it works. That's on you cs50;)) *NOTE*
    
    After logging in the program will display student_faculty.html which contains two buttons, Faculty and Student,
    but only if you've never logged in before.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    If you press Faculty, the website will call upon faculty.php which takes you to a template called hours.php. This form displays
    a page that allows the faculty member to input their name, class title, day, start time, end time, and location. Once all the
    information is submitted and the user clicks submit, faculty.php adds all of the information to a mySQL database called faculty
    and renders a page that summarizes the information provided.
    
    The page also contains links to log out, doubly-register as a faculty member (as in the case of some student-TF's), delete or edit
    hours.
    
    If you choose to edit your hours, then the website will again call upon hours.php for user input. If the user inputs office hours
    on a different day, then an entirely new entry will be added to the mySQL database, but if the user inputs office hours on a
    preexisiting day,then hours.php will update the mySQL entry for that day with new times.
    
    If you want to delete hours, then simply click delete and your information will be removed form the mySQL database.
    
    After doing either of those things, the website will render the page that summarizes your office hour info and contains the
    aforementioned links.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If you press Student at the buttons page, the website will call upon student.php which will render the student homepage, portfolio.php, which simply
    displays your professors' and TF's existing office hours in a sleek, refined sticky note design, and if they have none, calls upon
    search.php, which allows the user to search for their faculty member and subsequently add the faculty members info as a sticky note.
    
    Rather than display the faculty member's information for the user and then add it to his/her portfolio page, we chose to directly
    add a sticky note to portfolio.php simply because it was easier to implement and more user-friendly.
    
    Portfolio.php also contains links to doubly-register as a faculty member (as in the case of some student-TF's), search for other
    faculty, and logout.
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If you have already logged in before, then the website will skip student_faculty.html and take you to the appropriate faculty
    or student page. Henceforth, the website will operate as mentioned in the above two paragraphs depending on whether or not you're
    registered as a student or faculty member. 
    
    *NOTE* If you do become doubly registered as a faculty member, then you'll be able to view your office hours via the "View Office
    Hours" which renders the same page via hours.php. *NOTE*

    Well that's all for design!! I hoped you enjoyed taking a detailed look "under the hood" of Office Hour Buddy!
