Hello User. Welcome to the user manual of officehourbuddy!!!

Ever agonized over the lack of a centralized database of faculty office hours? Well agonize no more!

Office Hour Buddy is a website that allows students to search for their professors and TF's and displays them in a simple sticky note
design. It also allows faculty members to input and update their office hours into the database.

Before getting started, we'll have to go through some standard protocol to allow the website to work:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Start up your appliance and, upon reaching John Harvardâ€™s desktop, open a terminal window and execute
    update50
to ensure that your appliance is up-to-date!

Unzip officehourbuddy.zip

Move this new folder (officehourbuddy) from your downloads to your vhosts folder
    
Execute in your terminal window
    cd officehourbuddy

Followed by
    ls

You should see that officehourbuddy contains four subdirectories: cs50-id, includes, public, and templates. This also contains the 
documentation.txt, design.txt, and the officehourbuddy.sql. 

Next, ensure a few directories are world-executable by executing
    chmod a+x ~
    chmod a+x ~/vhosts
    chmod a+x ~/vhosts/
    chmod a+x ~/vhosts/officehourbuddy/public

Change your directory by executing
    cd ~vhosts/officehourbuddy/public

Ensure these are world-executable by executing 
    chmod a+x css fonts img js
    chmod a+r css/* fonts/* img/* js/*

We need to associate the appliance's own IP address with officehourbuddy so that it "resolves" via DNS to it. Rather than set up
a whole DNS server to do that, we can actually edit a file called hosts in a directory called etc. Let's do that.

In a terminal window, execute
    sudo gedit /etc/hosts
Carefully add this line at the bottom of that file, which will associate officehourbuddy with the appliance's "loopback" address.
    127.0.0.1 officehourbuddy
Then save the file and quit. 

Head over to http://officehourbuddy/phpmyadmin using Chrome inside of the appliance. Log in as John Harvard if prompted (with 
username of jharvard and a password of crimson). 

Open officehourbuddy.sql which is contained within the hudsbook folder. Highlight it all, copy, then return to phpMyAdmin.
Click phpMyAdmin's SQL tab, and paste everything you copied into that page's big text box and click Go. A greenish 
banner will appear indicating success. You should now see the link to a database called officehourbuddy in phpMyAdmin's top-left 
corner.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, good work! Now that you've set up the necessary components, it's time to give the website a look!

Visit http://officehourbuddy/ in your browser. You should be taken to a beautifully designed page with our logo and a log in button.

Click on the button, and you'll be directed to the oh so familiar Harvard University Login Page. Log in with either your HUID and password,
your @college email address and password, or if you're a faculty member, your @fas email address and password.

If this is your first time logging in, you'll arrive at a page after you log in that contains two buttons, Faculty and Student. Click on
the button that applies to you, and you'll be redirected accordingly. On subsequent log ins, the website will remember who you are, so you'll
never see this page again. How incredible!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*IF YOU'RE A FACULTY MEMBER*

After clicking Faculty, you should arrive at the homepage, which is a list of information about your office hours that you must input.

Input in your information and click submit, and your new office hour information should appear for you on the screen!

If you'd like to edit your office hours, then click on "Edit Hours" which will take you back to the same information input page.

If you'd like to add hours, then also click "Edit Hours," but once you input a different day, your new homepage will display all of your hours,
essentially adding the hours to your existing list.

Hate your hours? Then click "Delete Hours" and POOF! Your hours are gone. Feel free to input new hours if you'd like.

*NOTE* If you'd like to doubly register as a student (for all you overachieving student-TF's), then click on the link "Register as
Student" and you'll be taken to the student homepage. If you'd like to view your office hours as a doubly registered student-TF,
click "View Office Hours" *NOTE*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*IF YOU'RE A STUDENT*

After clicking student, you should arrive at your homepage. If this is your first time, then nothing should appear but a faculty search
box.

Type in the name of your professor and voila! A sticky note should be "stuck" to your homepage with the information of your
TF's or professor's office hours. If you'd like to search for another TF click the link "Search for TF." Slowly, you'll build up your
wall of colorful sticky note office hours!!

From now on, once you log in to Office Hour Buddy, you'll be greeted by your personalized wall of office hours!

*NOTE* If you'd like to doubly register as a faculty member (for all you overachieving student-TF's), then click on the link "Register as
Faculty" and you'll be taken to the faculty homepage. If you'd like to view your office hours as a doubly registered student-TF,
click "View Office Hours" *NOTE*

do is log in to Office Hour Buddy!!!!!!!
